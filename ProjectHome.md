If you are a beginning c++ programmer with some experience in other languages or scripting, writing a minigame can be a nice first challenge. Fast results, help from developers and users on the GP32X forum, and it will be probably be inluded in a PandoraPanic Update as well (Project Owners will reject offensive minigames and copyrighted material, and might reject pointless, stupid or defect ones. But use those last terms loosely ; )


This project makes extensive use of [Penjin](http://projectinfinity.org.uk/doku.php/homebrew:engines:penjin), an easy to use c++ game creation framework
